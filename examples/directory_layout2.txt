This is particularly useful if your group_vars/host_vars donâ€™t have that much in common in different environments. 
The layout could look something like this:

inventories/
   production/
      hosts               # inventory file for production servers
      group_vars/
         group1           # here we assign variables to particular groups
         group2           # ""
      host_vars/
         hostname1        # if systems need specific variables, put them here
         hostname2        # ""

   staging/
      hosts               # inventory file for staging environment
      group_vars/
         group1           # here we assign variables to particular groups
         group2           # ""
      host_vars/
         stagehost1       # if systems need specific variables, put them here
         stagehost2       # ""
